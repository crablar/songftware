				<h1>Music can be written like software. </h1>
			       <div>
								<div>
				<p>A team of engineers with defined workflows can produce music quickly and with minimal conflict. An example album workflow is outlined by the following Trello:</p>
			      <img src="http://jeffmeyerson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/trello.jpg" alt="">	
				<p><i>Tepid Moonlight</i> and <i>Inclination Point</i> are cards that represent songs being worked on in the example.</p>
				<p>Some additional rules that could accompany this board:</p>
				<ul style="color:white">
				<li>every card starts at the far left, with the composer designing the chord progression</li>
				<li>a card in any column can only be worked on by the people mentioned in the header (for example, as long as Tepid Moonlight is in the “chord progression” column, the only person working on it is the composer)</li>
				<li>after finishing with her responsibilities, the person who currently controls the card can move it one slot, either left or right; after the composer finishes Tepid Moonlight, she can hand it off to the synth engineer; after composing an implementation of the chord progression, the synth engineer can choose to hand it back to the composer, and ask for a reiteration; or he can pass it forward one column to the percussion engineer</li>
				<li>when a card is being moved, the person receiving the card chooses the format the song will be exported with; for example, even if the percussion engineer is working on Inclination Point  in Ableton, the mixer engineer may prefer Reason, and can ask the percussion engineer to export each individual track within Inclination Point to wav</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This approach to song management intends to solve some of the problems of modern music collaboration:</p>
				<ul style="color:white">
				<li><b>Instruments no longer enforce division of labor.</b> Every member of a serious band probably knows the basics of computer music production. This is both empowering and a source of potential conflict. If John Lennon could program the drums, it would be less clear what Ringo’s responsibilities are.</li>
				<li><b>Digital audio workstations aren’t cross-compatible.</b> There is no great way to transfer work for a song from GarageBand to FL Studio to Ableton. But there are some pretty good ways. One technique is to take each track and export a wav file corresponding to it, with a length equivalent to the length of the entire song. For example, take the percussion engineer working on Inclination Point, who has finished with the drums he was working on. If Inclination Point is 4:00 long and has a cymbal crash at 2:20 and 3:32, the percussion engineer would nonetheless export a 4:00 track including just those cymbal crashes at those specific times.</li>
				<li><b>Music shouldn’t emphasize “muse”.</b> It is not an accident that the artists who tend to work the most on music tend to have the best output. Clear responsibilities, deadlines, and transparency encourage the team to think in terms of defined goals. The best artists don’t wait for serendipity. They consistently manufacture to the local maxima of achievable quality, which gradually improves.</li>
				</ul>
